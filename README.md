>!NOTE
>Unfortunately, it seems that macOS doesnt have any Roblox clients. The only logical way would be to port source code from a desktop client to macOS, which i am currently not capable of. And please, dont hesitate to make an issue in case my infos are wrong and there actually are Roblox clients for macOS. Thank you!

>!NOTE
>Unfortunately, it seems that ChromeOS doesnt have any Roblox clients either. This time around though, Bloxstrap might be possible via Linux (Crostini) if compiled from source, or Grapejuice / Sober since Linux wrappers can run if you enable Crostini too on ChromeOS. And please, dont hesitate to make an issue as well in case my infos are wrong and there actually are Roblox clients for ChromeOS. Thank you!
